Currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science, Oregon State University, supervised by [Liang Huang](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.engr.oregonstate.edu%2F~huanlian%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFHU6yGdrdi_DKWd5qohgVGUB0JkQ). Previously got my B.S. from ECNU in 2017.

My thesis is on Neural Machine Translation. I also have a broad interest on Reinforcement Learning and Semantic Parsing.
