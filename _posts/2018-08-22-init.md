This is my first time writing a blog. Hello world.

I evaluate myself good at general ideas, but **pretty**Â bad at specific skills (e.g. coding and writing). So I write this blog, both for sharing my thoughts and practising my writings. It'll also be great to have some audiences in the future (this might not be probable).
