This is my notes w.r.t. differential geometry study.  From the book "*first steps in differential geometry*", and this is only the linear algebra part.  Noted, this book isn't very well written, not written with good math intuitions (hard to understand).  But, it's very succinct to the essentials, so I'm try to understand it by my own. 

## Dual of a vector space, forms and pullbacks

### Dual of a vector space, aka. one-form, covector

Given V as a vector, its corresponding dual form is a map from V to R.
$V^* = V\to R$  could be regarded as a dot-product.
then, given $v\in R^2, T\in R^{2*}, T\circ v \in R$
could think of T as another $R^2$ vector, and the computation is dot-product.

### Pullbacks

Projection ($\Phi$) is a map from v to w, could be regarded as a matrix $\in R^{n\times m}$, while $v\in R^n, w\in R^m$. Then pullback($\Phi^\star$) is a map from $w^\star$ back to $v^\star$, while they're all covectors.  A pullback could be regarded as the transpose of the corresponding projection matrix, namely, $\Phi^\star = \Phi^T$.

Pullback is defined this way:
$$(\Phi^*(T))(v) = T(\Phi(v))$$, while $$T\in W^*$$ and $$v\in V$$.
In the math understanding:

* left: pullback $$w^*$$ to $$v^*$$, then apply "dot-product" to v.
* right: project v to w, then apply $$w^*$$ to it, and get a real value.

While in the matrix understanding:

* Left = $$(\Phi^*\circ T)^T \circ v$$

* right=$T^T\circ \Phi\circ v$

We could easily observe that they are equal.

Noted: every time we apply dot-product, we need to transpose the former vector.
Then, we can understand $$(\Phi_2\circ \Phi_1)^* = \Phi_1^*\circ \Phi_2^*$$, by transpose of matrix multiplication.
